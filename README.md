Importing Modules:
The code starts by importing necessary modules:
tkinter (as tk): Used for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).
messagebox: A submodule of tkinter used for displaying message boxes.
ttk: Provides themed widgets (used for styling).



Creating the Main Window and GUI Elements:
A main window (root) is created using tk.Tk().
The window title is set to “Random Password Generator,” and the window size is set to 500x500 pixels.
The background color of the window is set to light gray (#f0f0f0).
A frame (frame) is added to the window with padding.


Password Length Input:
A label (length_label) displays “Password Length.”
An entry field (length_entry) allows the user to input the desired password length.
Character Set Checkboxes:
Checkboxes (uppercase_checkbox, lowercase_checkbox, digits_checkbox, symbols_checkbox) allow the user to select character sets (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols) for the password.
Generate Password Button:
A button (generate_button) labeled “Generate Password” triggers the generate_password function when clicked.


The function:
Retrieves the desired password length.
Constructs a character set based on the selected checkboxes.
Generates a random password using the selected character set and specified length.
Displays the generated password in an entry field (password_entry).
Password Display Entry Field:
An entry field (password_entry) displays the generated password (masked with asterisks).


Copy Password Button:
A button (copy_button) labeled “Copy Password” triggers the copy_password function when clicked.

The function:
Copies the password from the entry field to the clipboard using pyperclip.
Shows a message box indicating successful copying or warns if there’s no password to copy.

Button Styling and Animation:
Buttons change color when hovered over (on_enter and on_leave functions).
The “Generate Password” button pulsates between green (#4CAF50) and turquoise (#5EBABA) colors.

Main Event Loop:
The root.mainloop() call starts the main event loop, which keeps the GUI window open and responsive.
When the user interacts with the GUI (e.g., clicks buttons), the associated functions are executed.
